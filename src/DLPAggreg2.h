 *
 * This library is a C++ implementation of several algorithms that enables
 * to aggregate set of data according: an ordered dimension (OLP), a
 * hierarchy (NLP), or both (DLP). OLP and NLP scalar versions (1) have been
 * designed by Robin Lamarche-Perrin. OLP and NLP vector versions (2, 3) and
 * DLP (1, 2) have been designed by Damien Dosimont and are a generalization
 * of Robin Lamarche-Perrin works.
